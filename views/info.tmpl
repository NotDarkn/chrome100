  <h1>Chrome100 Information</h1>
  <h2>What is Chrome100?</h2>
  <p>Chrome100 is a directory of recovery images for Google's operating system Chrome OS.</p>
  <h2>Why are you collecting thousands of Chrome OS builds!?</h2>
  <p>
    Chrome OS recovery images are a necessity for any IT admins or a Chrome OS
    hobbyist. Chrome OS recovery images can be used to repair broken installs of
    Chrome OS, bypassing being pinned to an outdated version of Chrome OS, or
    more desirably: downgrading to an earlier version of Chrome OS.
  </p>
  <h2>Why downgrade?</h2>
  <p>
    Downgrading Chrome OS may be done in order to continue using a deleted
    feature, patched bug, or to avoid a new feature. This opens the door to many
    patched CVEs and exploits being used, despite being patched in newer
    versions of Chrome OS.
  </p>
  <h2>Will these recovery images work on my managed Chromebook?</h2>
  <p>
    Yes. Although your IT admin may notice you&apos;re on an earlier version of
    Chrome OS (which often goes unnoticed).
  </p>
  <h2 id="shim">What are RMA shims?</h2>
  <p>
    RMA shims are disk images stored on USB devices that contain a combination
    of the ChromeOS factory bundle components used to reinstall the operating
    system and tools for performing repair and diagnostics.
    <br />
    The Sh1mmer exploit uses publicly leaked RMA shims to modify the management of
    enrollment of devices. It allows users to unenroll enterprise-managed Chromebooks
    and bypass device restrictions. It was developed by security researchers from
    the Mercury Workshop Team.
